/*!
`dfraw_json_parser` provides a way to turn raw files from Dwarf Fortress into JSON. It's
currently useful for getting some basic information from from a limited set of raw types:

- creatures
- plants
- inorganics (rocks, ores, etc)
- materials
- syndromes
- graphics (sprites and tile pages, some layer support)
- limited template support, creature variations support, and select XX support

## How It Works

It functions using a regular expression to break apart the tokens and then checks the
key in the token against a long list of ones it knows about. Any matches are utilized to
build its own representation of the raw. Optionally you can turn this result into JSON using
the `serde_json` library. Or I guess turn it into anything serde supports.

## Glossary of Terms

### Raw

A raw is a definition used by Dwarf Fortress to create creatures, things and objects in the world.
They can be used to also define how things interact. They are composed of a variety of tokens inside
a raw file, starting with an identifier token of `[#type#:#identifier#]`. Raws can also select and
modify other raws using a `[SELECT:#identifier#]` token.

### Raw File

A raw file is a single text file (with .txt extension) which has the first line as the raw file
identifier, and then defines the type of raw file using the `[OBJECT:#type#]` token. The file can
contain any number of raws of that type.

### Raw File Module, Raw Module

Since Dwarf Fortress 50, raws are organized into directories. (Previously they were in a flat
structure.) This was done to facilitate the steam workshop.

### Raw Module Location, Module Location

Raw file module folders are located in 3 locations that this library recognizes:

- `$df_game_dir/data/vanilla`: the vanilla raws are here
- `$df_game_dir/data/installed_mods`: the workshop mods which have been used in generating a world
  are here. They are considered installed because they are in use by at least one world. (Note: these
  are never removed even if you delete all worlds which use them.)
- `$df_game_dir/mods`: the workshop mods are stored here to be available when creating a world

### Info Text File

In each raw module, there is an `info.txt` file which contains information about that module, like
author, version, earliest compatible version (for updating in existing saves), and information
for the steam workshop if it is a mod downloaded from the steam workshop.
